# Data collection

* Sample rate: 40 Hz
* Window size: 80 samples (2s)
* Stride: ?? (some groups have 10 samples/0.5s)

Rate of data output = ?? (Once every 10 samples/0.5s if above stride is taken)

Action should be in the middle of sample due to nature of Conv1D

Enumerations:
* Grenade
* Shield
* Reload
* Punch
* Spear
* Hammer
* Portal
* Spider
* Logout
* Idle/Aiming?

# Preprocessing

* Vector and gyro normalization using linear detrend, then z-score
    * Detrend formula for $N$ points:
$$
y=mx+c
$$
$$
m = \frac{N\,\Sigma(xy)-\Sigma x\,\Sigma y}{N\,\Sigma(x^2)-(\Sigma x)^2}
$$
$$
c = \frac{\Sigma y - m\,\Sigma x}{N}
$$
    * Z-score formula:
$$
z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}â€‹
$$

* Balance data points so that number of samples per action is equal
* Train/test segmentation: 80/20 split looks good

# NN Architecture

Potential starting dimensions for each window:

### `(40, 12)` or `(1, 40, 12)`
* 40 for the amount of samples
* 12 for 3 sensors * 6 measurements
* `Conv2D` is possible but may hallucinate
* `Conv1D` looks promising, good separation

### `(40, 4, 3)` 
* 40 for the amount of samples
* 4 for each hand * each type of measurement
* 3 for $x,y,z$
* Better split of data
* Not odd, so awkward to train

### `(40, 2, 2, 3)`
* 40 for the amount of samples
* 2 for each hand
* 2 for each type of measurement (accel or gyro)
* 3 for $x,y,z$
* Very fine-grain
* But also nightmare to train

```python
# For (40, 6) case

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv1D(16, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(1, 40, 6)))

# Dimension: (38, 16)

model.add(Conv1D(32, 5, activation='relu'))

# Dimension: (34, 32)

model.add(Flatten())

# Dimension: (1088)

model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(6, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate = 0.001), loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])
```

Softmax formula for series $x_1\cdots x_n$:
$$
\text{Softmax}(x_i)=\frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^n\exp(x_j)}
$$

# Data Augmentation

* Adding random vector to each?
* Playing with window cutoffs

## Start of Move Detection

Set magnitude threshold and check for it. Once detected then send window to FPGA.

Quick magnitude algo:

$$
\text{QuickMag} = x^2+y^2+z^2
$$

Maybe send several windows over and confirm if all windows return the same output?

**Idea**: Use two neural networks, one to check if window is a move and the second for move idenification

# Porting to HLS

## Working With HLS

Apparently Vivado 2022.2 cannot synthesize/has bugs with AXI stream, so switched to 2019.1.

Initially values were integrated as part of BRAM, but Vivado 2019.1 takes extremely long time to synthesize (around 10 hours), and there is not enough area for implementation. 

~~Switched to loading values into IP using AXI stream, synthesis now takes 10 mins, enough area for implementation.~~

Bad idea, nightmare to initialize. Reduce network size to fit onto FPGA.
